## Using Cloudflare DNS Service

1. Uncomment the `dns` module in your `main.tf`.
2. Download and install the CloudFlare module: `terraform init`.
3. Export the following environment variables `CLOUDFLARE_EMAIL` and `CLOUDFLARE_API_KEY`, where `CLOUDFLARE_EMAIL` is your Cloudflare account email adress and `CLOUDFLARE_API_KEY` is your account Global API Key available in your [CloudFlare profile](https://dash.cloudflare.com/profile/api-tokens).
4. Execute `terraform apply`.

### CloudFlare API Token

If you prefer using an API token instead of the global API key, you will need to configure a token with the following four permissions:

| Section | Subsection | Permission|
| ------------- |-------------:| -----:|
| Account | Account Settings | Read|
| Zone | Zone Settings | Read|
| Zone | Zone | Read|
| Zone | DNS | Write|

Then, on step 3, instead of `CLOUDFLARE_API_KEY`, you will need to export the following variables `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN`, `CLOUDFLARE_ZONE_API_TOKEN`, and `CLOUDFLARE_DNS_API_TOKEN`. Each variable will contain the same value corresponding to your API token.

## Verifying the cluster state

On the login node :
- Verify SLURM cluster state: `sinfo`. You should see the number of nodes defined in `main.tf`.
and all nodes should have an idle state.
- Verify JupyterHub state: `systemctl status jupyterhub`. It should be active.
- Verify you can run interactive jobs: `salloc`
- Verify the home were created: `ls /home`. You should see as many home as there are guest account + centos account.

If you used the CloudFlare DNS Service
- Verify the domain name: go to https://${domain_name}. It should be JupyterHub login page.
