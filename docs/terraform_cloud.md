This document explains how to use Magic Castle with Terraform Cloud.

## What is Terraform Cloud?

infrastructure using a web browser or a REST API instead of the command-line. 
This also means that the provisioned infrastructure parameters can be modified

When provisioning in commercial cloud, Terraform Cloud can also 
provide a cost estimate of the resources.
